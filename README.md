### Title
Log Analysis with Regular Expressions

### Introduction
This project analyzes system log files generated by the ticky ticketing service. The service logs both successful operations (INFO) and failures (ERROR). By parsing these logs, we can extract valuable insights such as:

The most common error messages

Which users generate the most errors

Overall usage statistics per user

This project was developed as part of the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate (Course 2: Using Python to Interact with the Operating System).

### Features
Parse syslog entries using regular expressions

Count and rank error messages by frequency

Track per-user statistics (INFO vs ERROR)

Export results to CSV reports for further analysis

### How It Works
1. **Read the log file** 
 The script opens syslog.log and processes each line one by one.

2. **Extract key fields with regex**
 A regular expression is used to capture three elements from each log entry:

    - The log type (INFO or ERROR)

    - The message text (e.g., “Permission denied while closing ticket”)

    - The username in parentheses

3. **Aggregate statistics**

    - For ERROR entries, the script counts how many times each unique error message appears.

    - For all entries, it tracks per‑user counts of INFO and ERROR messages.

4. **Sort results**

    - Error messages are sorted by frequency (most common first).

    - User statistics are sorted alphabetically by username.

5. **Generate reports** 
 Two CSV files are created in the output/ folder:

    - error_message.csv → summary of error types and their counts

    - user_statistics.csv → per‑user breakdown of INFO and ERROR counts

### Usage
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DE-KHALED/log-analysis-regex.git
cd log-analysis-regex
```

Run the script:
```bash
python scripts/log_analysis.py
```
Check the generated reports in the output/ folder:

error_message.csv → error types and counts

user_statistics.csv → per-user INFO/ERROR counts

## Example Output
**error_message.csv**
```csv
Error,Count
Tried to add information to closed ticket,5
Timeout while retrieving information,2
Permission denied while closing ticket,1
The ticket was modified while updating,2
Ticket doesn't exist,2
user_statistics.csv
```
**user_statistics.csv**
```csv
Username,INFO,ERROR
ac,0,1
breee,0,1
blossom,1,1
jackowens,0,2
mdouglas,1,1
oren,0,2
```
